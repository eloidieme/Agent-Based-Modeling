## Agent-Based Modeling Notebooks

A collection of Agent Based Modeling notebooks developed as part of the ABM course at CentraleSup√©lec by Damien Challet.
There are 4 notebooks, each one exploring a different topic of Agent-Based Modeling.

* The first one is about the influence of strategies on price dynamics. We analyzed and quantified the influence of various trading strategies used by groups of agents on price dynamics.
* The second one investigates how price predictability can be detected, exploited and modified. In particular we looked at optimal learning and how it influences the distribution of the log-returns (e.g. haevy tails).
* The third one is about the Brock and Hommes model and the strategies described in their paper: see https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/amsndfwpp/11-06.htm
* The fourth one implements the Franke & Westerhoff model: see: https://www.uni-bamberg.de/fileadmin/uni/fakultaeten/sowi_lehrstuehle/vwl_wirtschaftspolitik/Team/Westerhoff/Publications/2011/JEDC_RF_FW_Fin.pdf
